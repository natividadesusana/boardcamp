# BoardCamp Project

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
BoardCamp is an online platform for renting board games. Users can browse a catalog of games, rent them for a specific period, and manage their rentals. The main features of the project include:

- View a catalog of board games available for rent.
- Rent a game by selecting the desired duration.
- Manage rentals by viewing active rentals and returning games.
- Add new games to the catalog (admin only).
  
BoardCamp was developed as a personal project to showcase my web development skills and provide a convenient solution for board game enthusiasts.

I chose to use React.js for the front-end because it provides a modular and efficient way to build user interfaces. For the back-end, Node.js was used along with PostgreSQL as the database management system. HTML and CSS were used for structuring and styling the application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality
- View Catalog (/games):
On the catalog page, users can view a list of board games available for rent. Each game is displayed with its name, image, and information about the stock and rental price per day.

- Rent a Game (/rent):
Users can rent a game by selecting the desired duration on the rental page. They can choose the start and end dates for the rental period and proceed with the rental process.

- Manage Rentals (/rentals):
The manage rentals page allows users to view their active rentals, including information such as the game rented, rental duration, start date, and end date. Users can also return games they have rented by clicking the "Return" button.

- Add New Games (admin only):
Admin users have the ability to add new games to the catalog by providing the game's name, image URL, stock quantity, and rental price per day.
